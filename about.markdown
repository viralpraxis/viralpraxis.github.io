Here I'm going to publish some stuff (mostly related to CS, mathematics and software engineering)

I'm currently working towards a master's degree in computer science and mathematics at Saint-Petersburg State University. Also working for some years as a ruby backend engineer.

My primary areas of interest are
- distributed systems
- highload systems
- system design
